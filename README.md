## Installation

### For Python Script üêç

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ItsAmoduu/Calcolator.git
    cd Calcolator
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Ensure `admin_error.py` is included**:
    - The `admin_error.py` file must be in the same directory as `main.py`. You can view or download it from [here](https://github.com/ItsAmoduu/Calcolator/blob/main/admin_error.py).

4. **Run the script**:
    - **On Windows**:
      ```bash
      python main.py
      ```
    - **On macOS and Linux**:
      ```bash
      python3 main.py
      ```

### For Executable üíª

1. **Download the executable**:
    - Download the appropriate executable for your platform from the [releases page](https://github.com/ItsAmoduu/Calcolator/releases).

2. **Ensure `admin_error.py` is included**:
    - For the executable version, ensure that the `admin_error.py` file is in the same directory as the executable. This file is required for the executable to handle administrative permissions properly.

3. **Run the executable**:
    - **On Windows**: Double-click the `.exe` file.
    - **On macOS**: Open the `.app` file or run the terminal command:
      ```bash
      ./Calculator.app/Contents/MacOS/Calculator
      ```
    - **On Linux**: Make the file executable and run it:
      ```bash
      chmod +x Calculator
      ./Calculator
      ```

## Usage

After starting the program, you will see a menu with the following options:

1. Addition ‚ûï
2. Subtraction ‚ûñ
3. Multiplication ‚úñÔ∏è
4. Division ‚ûó
5. Equality üîç
6. Info ‚ÑπÔ∏è
7. Help ‚ùì
8. Exit üö™

Select an option by entering the corresponding number and follow the prompts to input numbers and get the result.

## Important Notes

- **Administrative Permissions**: Both the Python script and the executable may require administrative permissions to run properly. Make sure you have the necessary permissions, and if you encounter issues, try running as an administrator.
- **Compatibility**: The provided executable works on Windows, macOS, and Linux. Make sure to download the correct version for your operating system.
- **File Requirement**: The `admin_error.py` file is necessary for both the Python script and executable. Ensure it is in the same directory as `main.py` or the executable for proper functionality.
